== Description ==
We have created the ability for you to use your own WP All Import templates to speed load large lists of places and categories without having to manually input each one.

Using this CSV import feature through WP All Import and the Advanced Custom Fields power, this plugin is able to focus most on what it does best: create amazing maps that can be categorized and layered anyway you want.
